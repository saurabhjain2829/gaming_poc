Introduce 2 to 4 main characters, providing their names, traits, and roles within the storyâ€”clearly indicating which of them (or what symbols) act as the Wild, Scatter, and Bonus Trigger symbols. Define 10 to 12 reel symbols, broken down into high-value, mid-value, and low-value categories, and ensure they are thematically consistent with the story. Include descriptions of bonus features such as free spins, interactive story choices, or mini-games that tie into the narrative arc or character development. Also describe the visual and audio style, including background art, animation ideas, and soundtrack suggestions that enhance immersion.
